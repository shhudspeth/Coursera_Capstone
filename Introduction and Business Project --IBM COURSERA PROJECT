Top Food Venues near Hospitals in the SF Bay Area

1 Introduction

1.1 BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 novel coronavirus has hit regions of the United States in different ways.
Shelter in Place orders have quarantine people in their home, except for essential workers, 
many of whom are healthcare workers. 

This project seeks to find top food venues near hospitals in the Bay area (a region
comprised of nine counties) in hopes of not only keeping restaurants afloat, but also 
to potential connecting healthcare workers with generous folks who would give gift certificates 
or other gifts to healthcare workers in order to keep up morale. A few volunteer organizations 
in NY have done similar things for healthcare workers in New York. 

Kmeans clustering will also be used to cluster food venues and see if there 'at-risk' 
food clusters. With shelter-in-place many restaurants are losing income and work.
A secondary analysis will see if there are food venues that are of risk of closing 
and recommend that the community leverage social good and support both the local 
economy and healthcare workers. 


1.2 Problem
This project seeks to find clusters of food venues near hospitals in the Bay Area. 

1.3 Interest
This project seeks to do social and community analsyis during a time of crisis. 


2. Data Acquistion and Cleaning


2.1 Data Sources
This project will use hospital geolocation data, the Foursquare API, as well as 
Census Data (for healthcare workers), and potential unemployment data from Bureau 
of Labor. An exploration of foursquare may also give data on how restaurants are 
weathering Shelter in place. Secondary sources for food delivery may include 
grubhub and uber-eats data.
