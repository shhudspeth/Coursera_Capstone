A repo for the IBM Data Science Specialization Certificate

In the notebook folders, there are three notebooks that contain the three main parts of the project. The first notebook contains the hospital scrape off wikipedia. The second contains the Foursquare scrape, a yelp scrape, Kmeans clustering of food venue data, and preliminary correlary analysis of healthcare workers and food service workers. The third notebook contains clustered information, clustered venues by colors around hospitals as well as a choropleth map of Covid_cases current as of April 19th. 

As far as intrepreting the clusters and the preliminary analysis, much more work needs to be done. There is potential to make a webapp that lists the Bay Area hospitals and clustered food venues and links to delivery options.
